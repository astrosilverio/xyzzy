Trying to figure out how to do return values.

built-in commands:
look -- room description
inventory -- nothing
examine -- object description
go -- room description
take / drop -- nothing

commands can call commands? difference between a command and a return value?

Maybe return value comes from castle? Get changed state for player, return it?
