UGH more hacking / stabbing. Adding some more parsing to Legilimens, going to finally start tackling commands.

Some things that are bothering me: Maybe I haven't hit this point yet, but soon I'll have to start thinking about fixtures for testing.

Stuff not in log4: add a pre-commit to get rid of pdbs.

OH SNAP yeah eventually I'll need some sort of dev vm, once the basic engine works right.
# next level

AND I'll want a special way to write automated tests for your game. Maybe make it kinda like rspec, in the sense that the tests should read like text almost.
