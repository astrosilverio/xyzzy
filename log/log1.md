2.5 hours in to flight. Bored.

I feel like I would be writing soooo much more code if I knew I could get up and pee whenever I want. Also if I wasn't so hungry. Oh well.

10 minutes in to "working" on hogwarts project: have done little more than think and write a battle plan. Where is the battle? When is the battle? Why am I scared of the battle? 

Thought: I should maybe write blog posts documenting all the thinking about this project. Perhaps feedback would help with decision-making. Follow-up thought: writing is so much work.

14 minutes in to "working": let's write a kickoff blog post.

~hr into work. Finished one non-technical blog post stating intention to write more blog posts.
~hr +3 min. Can't decide whether to write technical blog post or code. SEND HALP
~hr + 10 min. Starting technical post. how to not word vomit.

~ 90 min into work, 4 hours into flight. legs cramping. cognizant of how meta this is. wondering if I can get away with calling this "The XYZZY Project". also wondering how hard it will be to give my tumblr a facelift.

Still haven't done anything except think about how to get cracking. Am I secretly a Ravenclaw? Where are the commits? Existential crisis

Thought: This is all sounding like a lot of work and I already have a full-time real job that I'm not very good at
Thought: zomg these should really go in the hogwarts dir and then I could commit them and NOT FEEL BAD

I am a genius but need to finish technical post before mindless text migration

2 hrs into work. Done with first semi-technical blog post! w00t w00t commencing migration
I COMMITTED OH BABY OH BABY
don't know what to do now

TODO: migration to markdown, learn how to make a test suite instead of having to nosetests every file, tell Allison of my genius

I feel so vain.

can't read JSON without thinking of the Spartax, thanks Captain Marvel and GotG
