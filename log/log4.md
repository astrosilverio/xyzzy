thoughts: last log post *could* be a blog post maybe? too large in scope.

so here's where I'm at:
I'm taking some time to set up, because I'm done with feeling janky and unprofessional on this project
so far today I've:
* made a new repo for the blog
* added my work laptop ssh key to github so no password input
* moved business_rules method to a feature branch
* set up a global .gitignore

And now I'm looking into setting up multiple github profiles
