So much for the regular updates :-/

In case anyone cares, I’ve been scarce because:

* I submitted a talk to PyCon;
* We’re rolling out a big new feature at work;
* My aunt got married;
* I had to do some maintenance on another personal project.

That’s not stuff that happens every month. And in the meantime, I’ve been doing research on `unittest.mock`, come up with a plan for implementing custom commands, and straightened out some misconceptions I had about how Python works. So that’s not so terrible.
